# Model Scaffolding with CRUD for .Net
ASP.Net MVC Model Scaffolding with CRUD operations taken to another level

This is not just a model scaffolding like the one already built-in for Visual Studio ASP.Net MVC.

You just list which models should be used for CRUD operations, and the code is already done.


With the current version for Visual Studio, if you make any changes in the Model already scaffolded, you have to either recreate them or manually edit the views and controller.

With this project, it is already done for you.

Currently, it only supports Models with the use of Entity Framework.
Use existing Data Annotations and our custom ones for annotating the models.

Use GitHub tools for suggestions/bugs.
